# undergrad-major-project
In my senior year of under graduation, I undertook this project that facilitated the training and placement department of my college(https://www.ycce.edu/) in managing their alumni database more efficiently. I worked on this project along with five of my colleagues, to create a system where we could record the most recent details of our alumni by extracting it from public social media systems so as to make the alumni database more usable. 

This project was a part of my internship at Persistent Systems(https://www.persistent.com/) where they along with the Head of our Computer Technology department, YCCE mentored us in developing this application.

Tools used - 
VBA for Microsoft excel
Visual Basics code
Microsoft Access Database.
